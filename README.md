This is my personal collection of **TamperMonkey** scripts that I use to tweak certain websites to my liking. Just simple improvements to make my browsing experience better.

##  Scripts  

###  Discord Tab Title Cleaner  

 **File:** `discord-tab-title-cleaner.user.js`  
 **Site:** [Discord](https://discord.com/)  

####  What it does:
- Removes the `| @username` part from the tab title  
- Ensures the title always stays as **"Discord"**  
- Automatically updates if Discord tries to change it back  

####  Why I Use It:
I don’t need my tab cluttered with usernames—just **"Discord"** is enough.

###  Hide Specific Button on X  

 **File:** `hide-button-x.user.js`  
 **Site:** [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/)  

####  What it does:
- Hides a specific button on **X** that I find annoying  
- Works even when new buttons are dynamically loaded  
- Uses **MutationObserver** to ensure it stays hidden  

####  Why I Use It:
Some buttons on X/Twitter are useless (to me), so I’d rather not see them.

##  Why This Repo?  
This is just a **personal backup** of my scripts so I don’t lose them if I switch browsers or reset my setup.  

That’s it. Just a small repo for my own use.
